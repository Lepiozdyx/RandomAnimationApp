# RandomAnimationApp

*RandomAnimationApp is an iOS application written in Swift that allows users to explore the functionalities of the SpringAnimation framework. The app provides a visual demonstration of various animations and displays a description of the current animation. By tapping the "Run" button, users can see different animations applied to the animationView.*

**Tech Stack**

- Swift
- UIKit
- SpringAnimation framework

**Features**

- Random animation generation: The app generates random animations using the AnimationPreset and AnimationCurve provided by the DataStore class.
- Animation description display: The descriptionLabel displays the details of the current animation, including the preset, curve, rotation, duration, and delay.
- Animation execution: The animationView animates based on the selected animation with the specified curve, rotation, duration, and delay.
- Animation randomization: Tapping the "Run" button triggers the generation of a new random animation, updating the description and animating the animationView accordingly.
- MVC architecture: The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for organizing and separating the data, user interface, and logic components of the application.

**Acknowledgements**

The RandomAnimationApp was developed as a learning project to explore the capabilities of the SpringAnimation framework. Special thanks to the creators of SpringAnimation for providing a powerful and intuitive animation library.

**Conclusion**

The RandomAnimationApp showcases the usage of the SpringAnimation framework in a simple and interactive way. It serves as a tool for users to experiment with different animations and gain a better understanding of the capabilities of the framework. Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the app to further your understanding of animations and the SpringAnimation framework.
